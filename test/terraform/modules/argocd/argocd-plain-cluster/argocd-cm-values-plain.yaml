    # status/operations processors:
    # Argo CD utilizes two queues to perform reconciliation (status) and application syncing (operations).
    # The number of processors to service those queues are controlled with the status and operations processor settings.
    # When the application reconciliation or sync is too slow, you need to increase the status and operation queue processors
    # status processors, as the name suggests is responsible to get the app info (Synced, Health, OutOfSync, Degraded, Unknown, Suspended, Missing, Error etc)

    # Description: Sets the number of processors for managing sync operations.
    # Default Value: 10
    # Like status processors, this boosts parallelism at the cost of additional resource usage.
