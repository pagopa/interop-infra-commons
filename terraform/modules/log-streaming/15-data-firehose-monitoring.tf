# AWS Data Fireshose Alarms - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/firehose-cloudwatch-metrics-best-practices.html
#
# Add CloudWatch alarms for when the following metrics exceed the buffering limit (a maximum of 15 minutes).
# - DeliveryToS3.DataFreshness
#
# Also, create alarms based on the following metric math expressions.
# - IncomingBytes (Sum per 5 Minutes) / 300 approaches a percentage of BytesPerSecondLimit.
# - IncomingRecords (Sum per 5 Minutes) / 300 approaches a percentage of RecordsPerSecondLimit.
# - IncomingPutRequests (Sum per 5 Minutes) / 300 approaches a percentage of PutRequestsPerSecondLimit.
#
# Another metric for which we recommend an alarm is ThrottledRecords.
# - ThrottledRecords (Sum per 5 Minutes) / 300 approaches a percentage of ThrottledRecordsPerSecondLimit.
